                <p>Firebase is Googleâ€™s Backend-as-a-Service (BAAS) solution for mobile app development. Originally, it was developed and launched in 2011 by Firebase Inc. and was later acquired by Google in 2014. Initially it started off as a realtime database and now offers developers and marketers a comprehensive selection of tools and products that not only help develop advanced applications, but also market them. The Firebase platform allows for easy integration with IOS, Android, Web, and Unity products.

                <p>
                    Node.js is an open-source backend javascript runtime environment. It is a used as backend service where javascript works on the server-side of the application. This way javascript is used on both frontend and backend. Node.js runs on chrome v8 engine which converts javascript code into machine code, it is highly scalable, lightweight, fast, and data-intensive. <br />
                    <br />
                    Node.js accepts the request from the clients and sends the response, while working with the request node.js handles them with a single thread. To operate I/O operations or requests node.js use the concept of threads. Thread is a sequence of instructions that the server needs to perform. It runs parallel on the server to provide the information to multiple clients. Node.js is an event loop single-threaded language. It can handle concurrent requests with a single thread without blocking it for one request.
